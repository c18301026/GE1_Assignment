# Description of the project (proposal)
My project idea is to create a system in Unity that will let a user listen to their own MIDI files while viewing visuals generated in response to the data from the MIDI file. The user may also customise the visuals of the animation itself, e.g., the colours, shapes and style.

The inspiration for this project idea is Stephen Malinowski's Music Animation Machine. Here is an example of Malinowski's work:
